# TaxiTag

Hi ! I'm TaxiTag, a french 🇫🇷 student.
I'm currently studying at EPITA Lyon.
Obviously, I'm interested in Computer Science, AI, Cybersecurity.

I have used multiple programming languages during my life :

- Python, for 7 years. I used it for small automation of tasks at first, then I used it for more ambitious projects such as developping bots on the internet and creating a custom memory storage and retrieval for AI models.

- C, it has only been 1 year. I started at EPITA by following the programmation course. I will use it for a personnal project that I have planned but not yet started.

- SQL, I have used it for as long as I can remember. I used it for data storage and retrieval, more recently to store and retrieve Magic The Gathering cards using their texts and / or names.
